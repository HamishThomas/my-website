<h2>By Hamish Thomas</h2>
<p>My name is <em>Hamish</em> <em>Thomas</em> and I was born on the 11th November 1998 in south-west London. When I was just 5 years old, I moved to America for family reasons, and as a result I spent a large percentage of my childhood living in <strong>Los</strong> <strong>Angeles</strong>, <strong>California</strong>. I attended primary school in LA and am still in contact with some close friends I made during my time there. In 2008 I returned to the UK, moving to Kent, where I went to secondary school and completed my <strong>GCSE</strong> and <strong>IB</strong> qualifications. This led me to an undergraduate <strong>engineering</strong> <strong>degree</strong> at <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/">Imperial College London</a>, in which I achieved a First-Class Honours and an award for my dissertation on COVID-19 particle dispersion. During my final year at Imperial, I decided that I wanted to transfer my engineering skills to the world of business, and also develop the analytical capabilities I obtained from my undergraduate degree. For this reason, the <strong>Masters</strong> <strong>in</strong> <strong>Analytics</strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong>Management</strong> at <a href="https://www.london.edu/">London Business School</a> seemed like the perfect fit, and I was luckily accepted onto this course, from which I will graduate in summer 2022.</p>
<p>My previous professional experiences are varied. Most notably, I have undertaken work in the engineering sector, where I worked with London’s Crossrail project (at Network Rail) as well as at a large automotive consultancy in Berlin (called IAV GmbH). I have also worked in teaching, digital advertising, football coaching and even in the National Health Service (NHS). I view my breadth of experience (at both an educational and professional level) as one of my strongest assets.</p>
<p>When I am not working, I have many other personal interests/hobbies. Some of these primary interests are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The</strong> <strong>Environment</strong></li>
<li><strong>Running</strong></li>
<li><strong>Guitar</strong> - an instrument I have played since the age of 10.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Politics</strong> - which I engage with actively as a volunteer for a UK political party.</li>
<li><strong>Football</strong> - which I like to coach, play and watch (primarily as an over-optimistic supporter of Tottenham Hotspur).</li>
</ul>
