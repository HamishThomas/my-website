description: This worked example is taken from the AM01 - pre programme assignment. It involves the analysis of the "Gapminder" dataset, which is used to compare life expectancies between different global regions. A dataset for "Brexit Results" was subsequently imported and used to understand which factors might contribute to "Leave" votes.

<p>This data can be used to produce two graphs of how life expectancy has changed over the years for the <code>country</code> and the <code>continent</code> I come from - in this case the <em>United</em> <em>Kingdom</em> and <em>Europe</em>. We will now produce three graphs which show how the life expectancy (for different regions) evolves over time, starting by filtering the data for these specific regions.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>country_data &lt;- gapminder %&gt;% 
            filter(country == &quot;United Kingdom&quot;) 
continent_data &lt;- gapminder %&gt;% 
            filter(continent == &quot;Europe&quot;)</code></pre>
<div id="life-expectancy-in-the-united-kingdom-over-time." class="section level2">
<h2>Life Expectancy in the United Kingdom over time.</h2>
<p>First, we plot of life expectancy over time for a single country of choice - the <em>United Kingdom</em>. This is done by mapping <code>year</code> on the x-axis, and <code>lifeExp</code> on the y-axis. We use ‘geom_smooth’ to incorporate a line of best fit, as well as ‘labs’ to label the graph.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot1 &lt;- ggplot(data = country_data, mapping = aes(x = year, y = lifeExp))+
   geom_point() +
   geom_smooth(se = FALSE)+
   labs(title = &quot;Average UK Life Expectancy over time.&quot;,
       x = &quot;Year&quot;,
       y = &quot;Average Life Expectancy&quot;) +
   NULL 
plot1</code></pre>
<pre><code>## `geom_smooth()` using method = &#39;loess&#39; and formula &#39;y ~ x&#39;</code></pre>
<p><img src="/blogs/Gapminder_files/figure-html/lifeExp_one_country-1.png" width="672" />
As we can see, the life expectancy in the UK has been gradually increasing since the 1950s, following what seems to be (close to) a linear progression.</p>
</div>
<div id="life-expectancy-in-europe-over-time." class="section level2">
<h2>Life Expectancy in Europe over time.</h2>
<p>Secondly, we produce a plot for all countries in <em>Europe</em>. This is done by mapping the <code>country</code> variable to the colour aesthetic. We also map <code>country</code> to the <code>group</code> aesthetic, so that all points for each country are grouped together.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(continent_data, mapping = aes(x = year  , y = lifeExp , colour = country , group = country))+
  geom_line() + 
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  labs(title = &quot;Average Life Expectancy over time for European Countries.&quot;,
       x = &quot;Year&quot;,
       y = &quot;Average Life Expectancy&quot;) +
  NULL</code></pre>
<pre><code>## `geom_smooth()` using method = &#39;loess&#39; and formula &#39;y ~ x&#39;</code></pre>
<p><img src="/blogs/Gapminder_files/figure-html/lifeExp_one_continent-1.png" width="672" />
Although this graph is hard to interperet, due to the large quantity of data, we can notably see that all European countries have seen an increase in life expectancy. The most notable outlier, Turkey, started with a particularly low life expactancy (less than 45) in 1950, but has now caught up with the rest of the pack.</p>
</div>
<div id="life-expectancy-in-different-continents-over-time." class="section level2">
<h2>Life Expectancy in different continents over time.</h2>
<p>Finally, using the original <code>gapminder</code> data, we produce a life expectancy over time graph, grouped (or faceted) by continent - using the ‘facet_wrap’ function. The legend is removed by adding the <code>theme(legend.position="none")</code> in the end of our ggplot.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(data = gapminder , mapping = aes(x = year , y = lifeExp  , colour = continent ))+
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~continent) +
  theme(legend.position=&quot;none&quot;) + #remove all legends
  labs(title = &quot;Average Life Expectancy over time for different Continents.&quot;,
       x = &quot;Year&quot;,
       y = &quot;Average Life Expectancy&quot;) +
  NULL</code></pre>
<pre><code>## `geom_smooth()` using method = &#39;loess&#39; and formula &#39;y ~ x&#39;</code></pre>
<p><img src="/blogs/Gapminder_files/figure-html/lifeExp_facet_by_continent-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>The continents that have seen the sharpest rises in life expectancy since 1952 are those which contain emerging economies. Countries that have exhibited substantial economic growth in this period, such as Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia and Mexico, are typically located in Asia or the Americas. This is likely why these continents seem to have exhibited the highest growth, as the economic development within their countries has led to improved healthcare, technology, diet and living standards.</p>
<p>Growth in Africa followed an upward trend between 1950 - 1990 that exhibited a similar gradient to other fast-growing continents. But this increase levelled off shortly after, which is likely due to limited economic power (which is enhanced by major corruption in many of these countries), as well as poor healthcare and many conflicts/wars on this continent causing many young deaths.</p>
<p>As expected, continents whose economic growth primarily accelerated before the 1950s - namely Europe and Oceania - exhibit a smaller increase in life expectancy during the above time-frame.</p>

<p>The data comes from <a href="https://www.thecrosstab.com/">Elliott Morris</a>, who cleaned it and made it available through his <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/courses/analyzing-election-and-polling-data-in-r">DataCamp class on analysing election and polling data in R</a>.</p>
<p>Our main outcome variable (or y) is <code>leave_share</code>, which is the percent of votes cast in favour of Brexit, or leaving the EU. Each row is a UK <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_Parliament_constituencies">parliament constituency</a>.</p>
<p>To get a sense of the spread, or distribution, of the data, we can plot a <em>histogram</em>, a <em>density</em> <em>plot</em>, and the empirical <em>cumulative</em> <em>distribution</em> <em>function</em> of the leave % in all constituencies.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># histogram

<p>One common explanation for the Brexit outcome was fear of immigration and opposition to the EU’s more open border policy. We can check the relationship (or correlation) between the proportion of native born residents (<code>born_in_uk</code>) in a constituency and its <code>leave_share</code>. To do this, let us get the correlation between the two variables. This can be done using the ‘cor’ function.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>brexit_results %&gt;% 
  select(leave_share, born_in_uk) %&gt;% 
  cor()</code></pre>
<pre><code>##             leave_share born_in_uk
## leave_share   1.0000000  0.4934295
## born_in_uk    0.4934295  1.0000000</code></pre>
<p>The correlation is almost 0.5, which shows that the two variables are positively correlated - although the correlation could be stronger (up to a potential value of +1).</p>
<p>We can also create a scatterplot between these two variables using <code>geom_point</code>. We also add the best fit line, using <code>geom_smooth(method = "lm")</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(brexit_results, aes(x = born_in_uk, y = leave_share)) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.3) +
  
  # add a smoothing line, and use method=&quot;lm&quot; to get the best straight-line
  geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;) + 
  
  # use a white background and frame the plot with a black box
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title = &quot;Relationship between the proportion of native born residents and leave share.&quot;,
       x = &quot;Born in the UK [%]&quot;,
       y = &quot;Leave Share [%]&quot;,
       subtitle = &quot;Figure 3.4&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## `geom_smooth()` using formula &#39;y ~ x&#39;</code></pre>
<p><img src="/blogs/Gapminder_files/figure-html/brexit_immigration_plot-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<pre class="r"><code>  NULL</code></pre>
<pre><code>## NULL</code></pre>
<p>This relationship clearly shows that constituencies with a larger percentage of native British people are more likely to have a larger leave share. This is expected as those born in the UK are expected to feel more nationalistic when it comes to the key issues of Brexit - namely, immigration, pressure on the NHS and other public services, etc.</p>
